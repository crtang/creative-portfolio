			<h2>About the Composer</h2>

			<p>
				Tang Rui Ting (pronounced <em><strong>tahng ray</strong>-ting</em>) is a pianist with a love for cinematic music and stories. Though she was classically trained, she grew up composing piano covers of her favorite songs. She also played two years of flute in a band. After developing arm problems toward the end of high school and several years of recovery, she eventually turned to writing and creating her own music, which she sometimes combines with the sounds of instruments from her Chinese heritage. She listens to alternative, indie, cinematic, and Christian, with a sprinkling of songs from other languages.
